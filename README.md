# Scalable_Analytic_System_DSC102
Course work of DSC102 (computing systems and infrastructure for scaling analytics to large datasets)
<br> This course includes the design of systems such as MapReduce/Hadoop and Spark, in conjunction with their implementation. I practiced dataflow operations to perform data preparation, cleaning, and feature engineering.
